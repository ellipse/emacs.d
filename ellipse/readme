1. add clang support for auto-complete. So you should first install clang and auto-complete-clang.

2. something else: yasnippet, mit-scheme and tabbar

3. To avoid re-install the whole emacs when using apt-get to install slime, download the slime from http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/#downloading and put it in the .emacs.d/site-lisp
